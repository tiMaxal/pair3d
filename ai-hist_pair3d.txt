integrate the essence of the mov3dpair app functionality into pair3d;
provide checkbox activation to the right of the present 2 checkboxes, labelled `move to '_x2_[folder]'`;
[move 'include singles' checkbox below 'process subfolders'];
show 2 radio options associated to `move to ..`, in list format below the checkbox, greyed out until activated, and only made available then if 'process subfolders' is active - `to root` + `to subdir's`;
process the moving *after* sorting is complete
